## Data Subject Requests (DSR)

- Export: compile subject data (JSON/CSV/PDF as applicable); include audit trail; deliver via signed URL with expiration.
- Erasure: soft-delete then hard-delete per retention; verify references removed; record erasure evidence.
- Legal holds: block erasure while hold active; record hold reason and owner.
- Escalation: if data cannot be fully deleted, escalate to compliance with documented justification.
